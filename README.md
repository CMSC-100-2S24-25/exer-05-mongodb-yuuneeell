# Exercise 06 - MongoDB

## Student Description

**Name:** Eunel Jacob C. Joyosa

**Degree Program:** BS Computer Science

**Section:** C-1L

## Key Takeaways from the Exercise
Doing this exercise felt very exciting, I really saw how Node.js, Express and MongoDB could be connected with each other and programmers like us get to program with tools like these on creating Web Servers and how it would have a Database connected to it. Took me a while to do this exercise, but in the end I still had fun.
